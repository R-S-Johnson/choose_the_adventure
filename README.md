# choose_the_adventure
Since I learned to program, I only ever thought of using nested if statements for choose your own adventure stories. But there are ways to run those stories that are easier to code and may be more efficient.

This package will use multiple different formats for representing choose your own adventures (trees, hash-tables, lists, etc) and will
measure the differences in performance, memory, and complexity.
